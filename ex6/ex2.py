""" Tool is an object that can be used pretty much in the same way as Character is able to utilize Items. 
There are different types of drills. One of them is a cordless drill. A drill bit can be attached to a cordless drill if its diameter is
less than 10 mm. However, the larger (than 10 mm) drill bits can be attached into
some other types of drills. There can be also different drilling tools which can be
attached into cordless drill. You can find more facts concerning tools if you visit
the websites of the stores where they sell for example cordless drills. Note, that
these tools have multiple other features, too. For example, manufacturer, model
and rounds per minute (RPM) value. Also the drilling tools that can be attached
may have maximum rounds per minute value which must not be exceeded.
Try to implement a class hierarchy that can solve the problem utilizing the proper
object-oriented mechanisms. Study the context and iterate your solution. Be crea-
tive! Try to model the real world with your code. Implement preconditions and
think how to manage the situation where the diameter of a drill bit has an upper
bound. How to implement the condition of RPM levels and in which classes? What
kind of modifying methods and methods for access are needed in classes? Remem-
ber the encapsulation. Use redefining the methods if it suits into your solution.
Follow the 11 principles that are given in lecture slides. The principles form the
core of any good solution. """
